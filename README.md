* Quick Repetition
A javascript library for ordering flashcards based on speed of answering on previous views. Similar to spaced repetition (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition), except focused on speed of recolection rather than ability to remember. The intended user is someone who has already memorized the content in the flashcards, but takes a while to recall the answer.

*** Motivation
Based on the experience of the author of this library, memorization practice often results in information that is commited to long-term memory but takes longer to recall than things that are known "by heart". Spaced repetition is a very effective system for getting new information to this level of memorization where the user knows the answers but cannot recall them immediately.  This can be a problem for applications such as learning to read a foreign language, where recollection of each character and/or word must be done almost instantaneously in order to read at a reasonable pace. This library is an attempt to address this gap between memorization and mastery. Please note that this approach is not based on any research or expertise and the efficacy has not been tested in any way.
